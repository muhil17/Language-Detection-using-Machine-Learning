# Language-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

Language detection is a natural language processing task where we need to identify the language of a text or document. Using machine learning for language identification was a difficult task a few years ago because there was not a lot of data on languages, but with the availability of data with ease, several powerful machine learning models are already available for language identification. So, if you want to learn how to train a machine learning model for language detection, then this repository is for you.

The most important part of training a language detection model is data. The more data you have about every language, the more accurate your model will perform in real-time. The dataset that I am using is collected from Kaggle, which contains data about 22 popular languages and contains 1000 sentences in each of the languages, so it will be an appropriate dataset for training a language detection model with machine learning.
